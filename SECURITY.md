# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead, use GitHub’s built-in private reporting:

- Create a private report via **Security Advisories** (preferred), or
- Contact the repository maintainers via a private channel associated with this repo’s GitHub organization/account.

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as appropriate.
