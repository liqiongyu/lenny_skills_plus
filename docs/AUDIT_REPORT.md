This report summarizes automated checks over the skill packs in `skills/`.

## Inventory
- Canonical skill packs under `skills/`: 87
- Converted Refound/Lenny skills: 86
- Meta-skill(s): 1 (`lenny-skillpack-creator`, etc.)

## Structural validation
- ✅ `python3 scripts/ci_check_skillpacks.py --skip-mirror-check` passed.
- ✅ Each skill pack contains: `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, and `references/` with the required core files.

## Frontmatter compliance (cross-tool)
- ✅ Every `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter with required fields (`name`, `description`).
- ✅ `name` matches the folder slug.
- ℹ️ Description YAML style: {'single_line': 42, 'folded_or_multiline': 45}

## Language check
- ✅ No CJK (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) characters detected across `skills/**/*.md`.

## Recommended ongoing checks
- Run `python3 scripts/ci_check_skillpacks.py --skip-mirror-check` before commits.
- After mirroring into `.codex/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`, run `python3 scripts/ci_check_skillpacks.py` to ensure mirrors are identical.
- Periodically smoke-test a few skills per category with real tasks.
