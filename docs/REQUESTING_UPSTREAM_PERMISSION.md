# Requesting explicit permission from RefoundAI (recommended)

This repo is derived from RefoundAI’s “Lenny skills” database. While we strive to be attribution-safe and avoid verbatim copying, the safest path for a public/open community project is to **ask RefoundAI for explicit permission** (and be ready to comply with any conditions or takedown requests).

## Suggested channels to reach RefoundAI

Because contact methods can change over time, prefer official channels:

- RefoundAI website: `https://refoundai.com/`
- RefoundAI “Lenny skills” pages: `https://refoundai.com/lenny-skills/`
- RefoundAI LinkedIn company page

If you have an existing relationship or can find an official email address on their site, use that.

## What to ask for (clear + specific)

Ask for permission to:
1) Publish and distribute the **converted “agent-executable” skill packs** in this repo.
2) Allow others to **use, fork, and contribute** improvements (PRs) to the converted packs.
3) Keep explicit upstream attribution and links, and promptly comply with takedown requests.

Be transparent that:
- This project is **not affiliated** with RefoundAI.
- The goal is to make the content more **agent-executable** (templates/checklists/quality gates), not to replace the upstream site.
- You’re happy to add any attribution language, restrictions, or remove content if requested.

Subject: Permission request — “Lenny skills” → agent-executable skill packs (with attribution)

Hello RefoundAI team,

I’m reaching out to request explicit permission to publish and distribute a community-maintained set of “agent-executable” skill packs derived from RefoundAI’s “Lenny skills” database.

What we built:
- A GitHub repository that converts the high-level “Lenny skills” into structured skill packs designed for AI agents (clear scope boundaries, input/output contract, step-by-step workflow, templates/checklists, and quality gates).
- The repository clearly attributes RefoundAI as the upstream source and includes a takedown process if you’d like any content removed or modified.

Our intent:
- We believe your “Lenny skills” are extremely valuable; this project aims to make them easier for agents to execute reliably (concrete deliverables instead of generic advice).
- We are not affiliated with RefoundAI and do not want to create confusion; we’re happy to add prominent attribution language and links to the upstream pages.

What we’re asking:
1) Permission to publish and distribute the converted skill packs in this repo.
2) Permission for others to use/fork the repo and contribute improvements via PRs.
3) If you have specific attribution requirements or restrictions, we’ll follow them.

If you prefer we remove certain skills, adjust phrasing, or add additional notices, we’re happy to comply. If you’d like, we can also discuss collaboration or an official/partnered version.

Thank you for your work and for considering this request,
[Your name]
