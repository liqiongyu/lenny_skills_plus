# Source notes (from Lenny skill)

This file preserves the core insights that were refactored into the workflows + templates in this skill.

- Start with PR/FAQ to force customer clarity (Press Release + FAQ).
- For AI features, treat evals as the “real PRD” that runs continuously.
- High-quality written artifacts drive cross-functional alignment (circulate widely).
- “Demos before memos”: prototypes and prompt sets can be the new PRD.
- Use AI to scaffold drafts, but keep a strong narrative and clear scope.
