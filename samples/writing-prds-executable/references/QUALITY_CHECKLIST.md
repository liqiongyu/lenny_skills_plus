# PRD quality checklist (copy/paste)

Clarity and narrative
- [ ] Clear “who + problem + why now”
- [ ] TL;DR is readable in < 1 minute
- [ ] Terms are defined once and used consistently

Scope discipline
- [ ] Goals are measurable
- [ ] Non-goals exist and are explicit
- [ ] Out-of-scope is not just “later”; it’s concrete

Requirements are actionable
- [ ] Requirements are numbered (R1…)
- [ ] Each requirement is testable (acceptance criteria or measurable)
- [ ] Vague words (“fast”, “easy”, “better”) are defined with thresholds or examples
- [ ] Non-functional requirements exist (perf, reliability, privacy, accessibility)

Success metrics and measurement
- [ ] North Star + supporting metrics are listed
- [ ] Instrumentation plan exists (events/dashboards/experiment)
- [ ] “How we know it worked” is unambiguous

Rollout readiness
- [ ] Milestones and launch criteria are defined
- [ ] Rollback plan exists
- [ ] Dependencies are listed (and owners)

Cross-functional circulation
- [ ] Support/Care: impact + FAQs + edge cases
- [ ] Marketing: positioning + claims we’re making
- [ ] Legal/Policy: privacy/compliance considerations
- [ ] Eng/Design/Data: feasibility and tradeoffs captured

AI-specific (only if relevant)
- [ ] Non-negotiable behaviors (MUST/MUST-NOT)
- [ ] Eval spec exists with test set + rubric + threshold
- [ ] Prompt set exists for prototyping + edge cases
- [ ] Monitoring plan for regressions

Finish
- [ ] Open questions have owners + next steps
- [ ] Document has a clear “decision needed” (approve? choose option? unblock?)
