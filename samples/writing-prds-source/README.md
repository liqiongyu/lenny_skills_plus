# Upstream source example (not bundled)

This folder intentionally does **not** include the upstream Refound/Lenny `SKILL.md` content.

If you want to compare “upstream skill → executable skill pack”:

- Upstream page: https://refoundai.com/lenny-skills/s/writing-prds/
- Upstream `SKILL.md` (if available): https://refoundai.com/skills/writing-prds/SKILL.md

See the converted executable version here:

- `samples/writing-prds-executable/` (or the canonical pack at `skills/writing-prds/`)
