# brand-storytelling

Create a **Brand Storytelling Pack**: brand narrative + founder/origin story anchored on a “five-second moment,” plus channel scripts, proof bank, build-in-public plan, and a Q&A bank.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (audience, channels, goal, constraints)
- Brand perception target (purpose + positioning + personality)
- Story brief (story type + five-second moment + stakes + CTA)
- Story scripts (2-minute + 30-second + website paragraph)
- Narrative beat map + proof bank (claims → proof → emotion → CTA)
- Build-in-public + distribution plan (pillars, cadence, owners, guardrails)
- Pithy answers + Q&A bank
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `brand-storytelling`. Company: <what you do>. Audience: <customers/investors/press>. Channels: <website/deck/social>. Desired perception: <3–5 adjectives>. Raw story material: <bullets>. Proof: <metrics/quotes>. Constraints: <tone/claims/taboo>. Output: a Brand Storytelling Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see `references/INTAKE.md`) and then proceed with explicit assumptions and placeholders (no invented facts).

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/brand-storytelling/`) using `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

## Example prompts
- “Turn our founder notes into a 2-minute origin story for a pitch and a one-paragraph website version.”
- “Create a build-in-public storytelling plan for the founder + 3 employees and include guardrails.”
- “Prep a pithy story + Q&A bank for an upcoming podcast interview.”
