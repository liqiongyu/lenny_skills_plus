# Building a Promotion Case (Skill Pack)

Build a promotion case and produce a Promotion Case Pack (target role + timeline, ladder mapping, evidence log, impact narrative, manager alignment plan, sponsor/visibility map, submission-ready promo doc).

## What you get
- A concrete workflow to turn “I want a promotion” into a **submission-ready** promotion packet
- Copy/paste templates for evidence logs, ladder mapping, manager alignment, and sponsor planning
- Checklists + rubric to keep outputs **specific, evidence-based, and ladder-aligned**

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:

- `.claude/skills/building-a-promotion-case`

## How to use

Invoke “building a promotion case” when you want concrete artifacts (not generic career advice).

Example prompts:
1) “Create a promotion case doc for me: target level, ladder mapping, evidence log, and a manager alignment plan. Ask me only 5 questions first.”
2) “Turn these 6 projects into a promotion packet with an impact narrative and sponsor plan. Assume our promotion committee is skeptical and time-constrained.”
