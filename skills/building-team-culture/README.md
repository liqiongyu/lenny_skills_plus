# Building Team Culture (Skill Pack)

Build or refresh a team culture and produce a Team Culture Operating System Pack (culture snapshot, culture code, norms, rituals, rollout + measurement plan).

## What you get
- A concrete workflow to **articulate** culture (not hand-wave it)
- Copy/paste templates for culture code, norms, rituals, and rollout plans
- Checklists + rubric to keep outputs specific and behavior-based

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/building-team-culture`
- `.claude/skills/building-team-culture`

## How to use

Invoke “building team culture” when you want executable culture artifacts (not generic advice).

Example prompts:
1) “Create a culture code for my product team with 5 principles, behaviors, decision rules, and anti-patterns. Then propose team norms and rituals to reinforce it.”
2) “Diagnose why psychological safety is low and propose 3 concrete changes we can implement this month. Include success signals and risks.”

## Files
- `SKILL.md` — the execution contract
- `references/` — intake, expanded workflow, templates, checklists, rubric, source summary
