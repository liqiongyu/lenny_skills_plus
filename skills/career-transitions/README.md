# Career Transitions (Skill Pack)

Use this skill to turn a vague “I want a change” into an **executable Career Transition Pack**: clear options, decision criteria, outreach scripts, and a 4–12 week experiment plan.

## How to invoke

Example prompts:
- “Use `career-transitions` to create a Career Transition Pack. Here’s my current role, constraints, and what I’m considering.”
- “Use `career-transitions` to build an option scorecard and a networking/outreach plan for a pivot into a new role.”

## What you get

The skill outputs a **Career Transition Pack** (in chat as Markdown; or as files if requested). Templates, checklists, and expanded guidance live in `references/`.
