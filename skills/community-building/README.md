# community-building

Build a **Community Building Pack**: strategy + platform plan + programming calendar + ambassador program + governance + measurement + 30/60/90 plan.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot + assumptions/TBDs
- Community thesis (movement/philosophy) + value exchange
- Community model + member journey + metrics
- Platform plan (home base + outposts) + influencer shortlist
- 30/60/90 launch plan + outreach scripts
- Programming & rituals calendar (4–8 weeks)
- Ambassador/champions program v1
- Governance/moderation + measurement cadence
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `community-building`. Product: <what it is>. ICP: <who>. Primary goal: <support/activation/retention/advocacy/feedback/upmarket>. Where members already are: <places>. Platform constraints: <Discord/Slack/forum/etc>. Resources: <owner, hours/week, moderators>. Output: a Community Building Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see `references/INTAKE.md`) and then proceed with explicit assumptions and options.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/community-building/`) using `references/TEMPLATES.md`.
