# Conducting Interviews (Skill Pack)

Run structured, behavioral hiring interviews and produce an Interview Execution Pack (plan, question map, script, scorecard, debrief template).

## What you get
- A repeatable workflow for **structured interviews** (screen or full loop)
- Copy/paste templates for interview plans, question maps, scorecards, and debrief summaries
- Checklists + rubric to keep interviews evidence-based and fair (not “vibes”)

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/conducting-interviews`
- `.claude/skills/conducting-interviews`

## How to use

Invoke “conducting interviews” when you want concrete interview artifacts (not generic hiring advice).

Example prompts:
1) “Create a structured 45-minute hiring manager interview for a Senior PM. Include a question map, interviewer script, and scorecard with rating anchors.”
2) “Design a full interview loop for a Design Lead. Map questions to our competencies and include a debrief template that forces evidence.”

- `references/` — intake, expanded workflow, templates, checklists, rubric, source summary
