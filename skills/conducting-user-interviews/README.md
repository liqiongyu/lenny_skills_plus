# Conducting User Interviews (Skill Pack)

This skill helps a **Product Manager** (and partners) plan, run, and synthesize high-signal user interviews into concrete artifacts: recruiting plan, interview guide, notes template, and synthesis report.

## Install

If you’re using this repo directly, the skill is discoverable under:
- `skills/conducting-user-interviews`

Repo convention: this skill should also be mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/conducting-user-interviews`
- `.claude/skills/conducting-user-interviews`

## Use

Invoke with a concrete request and context. Examples:
- “Create a recruiting plan and discovery interview guide for 10 interviews with first-time users.”

Expected deliverable: a **User Interview Pack** as described in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md), using templates in [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).
