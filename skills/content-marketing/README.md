# content-marketing

Create a **Content Marketing Plan Pack**: content market fit brief, demand-validated SEO topic map, channel/voice strategy, editorial calendar, content briefs, AI-assisted writing SOP, and a measurement plan.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (ICP, goal, metric, timebox, constraints)
- Content market fit brief (audience anxieties + promises)
- Channel + voice strategy (human spokesperson + primary channel focus)
- SEO demand-validated topic map (intent + evidence + angles)
- Prioritized backlog + 4–8 week editorial calendar
- 3 content briefs + distribution checklist per piece
- Announcement blog post template + 1 outline/draft (if relevant)
- AI-assisted content SOP (human-in-the-loop + information gain)
- Measurement plan + iteration cadence
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)

“Use `content-marketing`. Product: <what it is>. ICP: <who it’s for>. Goal: <metric + timebox>. CTA: <demo/trial/newsletter/etc>. Channels: <blog/LinkedIn/YouTube/etc>. Spokesperson: <who>. Constraints: <capacity/compliance/languages>. Output: a Content Marketing Plan Pack.”

If details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/content/`) using [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “Validate which topics have search demand and build a 6-week SEO editorial calendar with 3 briefs.”
- “Design a founder-led content program focused on LinkedIn posts + repurposed blog deep dives.”
- “Turn our product announcement into a first-person blog post and create a distribution plan.”
