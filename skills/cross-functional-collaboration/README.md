# cross-functional-collaboration

Create a **Cross-Functional Collaboration Pack** to reduce execution friction: clear mission, explicit roles/expectations, decision logging, operating cadence, and conflict/credit norms.

## What this skill produces
- Mission Charter
- Stakeholder & Incentives Map
- Roles & Expectations Contract (incl. decision rights + escalation triggers)
- Operating Cadence & Communication Plan
- Decision Log (seeded) + decision protocol
- Collaboration Norms (conflict protocol + credit/recognition plan)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `cross-functional-collaboration`. Initiative: <what>. Why now: <context>. Teams: <functions + key people>. Friction: <symptoms/examples>. Constraints: <timeline/non-negotiables>. Output: a Cross-Functional Collaboration Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/collaboration/<initiative>/`) using [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “We’re launching a cross-functional retention initiative; PM/Eng/Design are misaligned. Produce a Collaboration Pack and a conflict protocol.”
- “Set up decision rights + a decision log for a PM/Eng/Data partnership where analytics definitions keep drifting.”
- “Create a working cadence + credit norms for a cross-functional team across 3 time zones.”
