# defining-product-vision

Create a **Product Vision Pack**: a concrete, shareable description of the future product (5–10 years) that aligns leaders and teams and bridges into strategy (choices) and planning (roadmaps/OKRs).

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (product, customer, horizon, constraints)
- Potent user problem + target customer definition
- Vision statement (1 sentence) + vision narrative (future state)
- Vision pillars (3–5) + experience principles (optional)
- Strategy bridge (explicit choices + non-goals + near-term wedge)
- Rollout & alignment plan (workshop + comms + cadence)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `defining-product-vision`. Context: <product + customer + problem>. Horizon: <5–10 years>. Constraints: <must-haves / must-not-break>. Output: a Product Vision Pack.”

If details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see `references/INTAKE.md`) and then proceed with explicit assumptions and 2–3 options.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/product-vision/`) using the templates in `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

## Example prompts
- “We’re a B2B workflow automation product for IT teams. Define a 5–10 year product vision with pillars and a strategy bridge (choices + non-goals).”
- “We have a vague vision statement (‘the backbone of X’). Rewrite it into a concrete product vision pack and propose a rollout plan to align execs.”
- “We’re building a new AI product. Help us find the right ‘form factor’ wedge so the long-term vision lands with mainstream users.”
