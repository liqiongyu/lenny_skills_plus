# designing-growth-loops

Create a **Growth Loop Design Pack**: loop map (micro + macro), loop scorecard, channel fit and paid-loop feasibility gates, measurement plan, and a prioritized experiment backlog.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (goal, ICP/segments, constraints, timebox)
- Loop inventory + baseline (what drives growth today)
- Loop map (qualitative model) + bottleneck hypotheses
- Loop candidates + mechanism library (ethical/policy-compliant)
- Loop scorecard + selection (top 1–2 loops to build/scale)
- Measurement + instrumentation plan (KPIs + leading indicators)
- Experiment backlog + 30/60/90 plan
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)

“Use `designing-growth-loops`. Product: <what it is + for whom>. Stage: <pre-PMF/early PMF/growth>. Goal: <metric + by when>. Current channels: <what drives growth today>. Constraints: <budget/capacity/policy>. Output: a Growth Loop Design Pack.”

If details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/growth-loops/`) using [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “Map our micro and macro growth loops, pick the top two to build next quarter, and give us a 30/60/90 plan.”
- “We think paid acquisition could work—validate the paid loop feasibility with unit economics gates and propose first experiments.”
- “We’re in a fast-moving category. Propose 2 ‘bigger bet’ loops and an innovation vs optimization split.”
