# Dogfooding (Skill Pack)

Run an internal **dogfooding program/sprint** so the product team experiences real workflows and turns that experience into prioritized fixes and decisions.

## What you get
- A repeatable workflow to run dogfooding weekly/daily
- Copy/paste templates for a **Dogfooding Pack** (charter, scenarios, log, triage, report)
- Checklists + rubric to keep dogfooding from becoming “random QA”

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/dogfooding`
- `.claude/skills/dogfooding`

## How to use
Invoke “dogfooding” when you want a concrete **Dogfooding Pack** (not general advice).

Example prompts:
1) “Create a 1-week dogfooding sprint for <product>. We ship in 2 weeks. Focus on <workflow A/B>. Output the full Dogfooding Pack.”
2) “We’re building a creator tool. Design creator commitments for the team and a weekly report template.”
