# Energy Management (Skill Pack)

Build an Energy Management Operating System Pack (energy drivers/drains map, calendar energy audit, zone-of-genius expansion plan, energy-aligned weekly schedule, recovery routines, and 2-week experiments).

## What you get
- A concrete workflow to redesign your week around energy (not generic productivity tips)
- Copy/paste templates for an energy log, calendar audit, delegation/offload plan, meeting rules, and a 2-week experiment tracker
- Checklists + rubric to keep the plan practical, measurable, and leadership-safe

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/energy-management`
- `.claude/skills/energy-management`

## How to use

Invoke “energy management” when you want concrete artifacts to reduce energy drains, expand zone-of-genius work, and create sustainable leadership routines.

Example prompts:
1) “Create an Energy Management Operating System Pack for me. Include a drivers/drains map, calendar audit, and a default week schedule.”
2) “I want to reduce meeting fatigue. Produce meeting rules, delegation/offload plan, and a 2-week experiment tracker.”
