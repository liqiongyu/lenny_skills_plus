# Evaluating Candidates (Skill Pack)

Make an evidence-based hiring decision and produce a Candidate Evaluation Decision Pack (criteria + scorecard, signal log, work sample/trial plan + rubric, reference check kit, decision memo).

## What you get
- A repeatable workflow to turn mixed hiring signals into a decision-ready recommendation
- Copy/paste templates for scorecards, work samples/trials, reference checks, and decision memos
- Checklists + rubric to reduce bias and avoid “confident but shallow” false positives

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/evaluating-candidates`
- `.claude/skills/evaluating-candidates`

## How to use

Invoke “evaluating candidates” when you want concrete hiring decision artifacts (not generic advice).

Example prompts:
1) “Summarize all signals for this candidate, create a scorecard, and write a hire/no-hire decision memo with risks and mitigations.”
2) “Design a job-relevant work sample (or paid trial) for a Senior PM and include a scoring rubric + reference check script.”
