# Evaluating Trade-offs (Skill Pack)

Evaluate trade-offs and produce a Trade-off Evaluation Pack (brief, options+criteria matrix, all-in cost/opportunity cost, impact ranges, recommendation, stop/continue triggers).

## What you get
- A repeatable workflow to turn “pros/cons” debates into decision-ready artifacts
- Templates for cost/impact ranges, assumption tracking, and “worse-first” mitigation planning
- Checklists + rubric to avoid false precision and sunk-cost traps

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/evaluating-trade-offs`
- `.claude/skills/evaluating-trade-offs`

## How to use

Invoke “evaluating trade-offs” when you want concrete trade-off artifacts (not generic advice).

Example prompts:
1) “Evaluate build vs buy for analytics. Include all-in costs, impact ranges, and a recommendation with risks.”
2) “We’re debating ship fast vs ship better. Create a trade-off pack and propose a ‘worse-first’ mitigation plan.”
