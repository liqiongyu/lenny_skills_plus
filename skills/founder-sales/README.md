# founder-sales

Create a **Founder Sales Sprint Pack**: ICP wedge + outreach sequences + diagnostic discovery kit + decision enablement (beat “no decision”) + white-glove activation plan.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (goal, stage, constraints, time box)
- ICP wedge + founder POV one-pager
- Targeting plan + target list table
- Outreach kit (warm intro ask + cold sequence + follow-ups)
- Diagnostic discovery kit (no-demo-first agenda + questions + call notes)
- Decision enablement kit (decision guide + risk reversal + mutual action plan)
- White-glove activation plan (implementation checklist + 30-day success plan)
- Learning loop (tracking + weekly iteration)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `founder-sales`. Context: <product + who it’s for>. Goal: <first X customers by date>. ICP: <roles + company type>. Offer: <price/pilot>. Proof: <founder credibility + proof points>. Constraints: <time/week + channels>. Output: a Founder Sales Sprint Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see `references/INTAKE.md`) and then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/founder-sales/`) using `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

## Example prompts
- “Prospects keep stalling—create a decision guide and MAP to reduce ‘no decision’.”
- “Write a diagnostic discovery script that avoids demos and ends with a clear next step.”
- “We close verbally but onboarding stalls—create a white-glove activation plan and follow-up cadence.”
