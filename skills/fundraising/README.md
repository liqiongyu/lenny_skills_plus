# Fundraising (Skill Pack)

Use this skill to decide whether to raise venture capital and run an early-stage raise as an executable process: narrative, deck outline, investor pipeline, outreach scripts, and diligence prep.

## How to invoke

Example prompts:
- “Use `fundraising` to create a Fundraising Pack. Here’s our company, traction, runway, and what we’re trying to raise.”
- “Use `fundraising` to help me decide whether to raise or bootstrap, then produce a deck outline and investor outreach plan.”

## What you get

The skill outputs a **Fundraising Pack** (in chat as Markdown; or as files if requested). Templates, checklists, and expanded guidance live in `references/`.
