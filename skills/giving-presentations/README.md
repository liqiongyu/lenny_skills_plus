# Giving Presentations (Skill Pack)

This skill helps a **Product/Tech leader** plan and deliver persuasive presentations (internal or external) by producing a concrete **Presentation Pack**: brief, narrative, slide outline + talk track, Q&A bank, pre-brief plan, and rehearsal plan.

## Install

If you’re using this repo directly, the skill is discoverable under:
- `skills/giving-presentations`

Repo convention: this skill should also be mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/giving-presentations`
- `.claude/skills/giving-presentations`

## Use

Invoke with a concrete request and context. Examples:
- “Turn this doc into a 10-minute exec presentation with a clear ask.”
- “Create a slide-by-slide outline and talk track for my all-hands update.”
- “Prep me for Q&A and objections for a roadmap review.”

Expected deliverable: a **Presentation Pack** as described in `SKILL.md`, using templates in `references/TEMPLATES.md`.
