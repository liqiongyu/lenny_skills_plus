# Having Difficult Conversations (Skill Pack)

Prepare and lead difficult conversations as a manager/leader and produce a Difficult Conversation Pack (conversation brief, talk track/script, objection+emotion handling plan, follow-up note, and quality gates).

## What you get
- A concrete workflow to prepare hard conversations with clarity + care
- Copy/paste templates for briefs, scripts, reaction handling, and follow-ups
- Checklists + rubric to reduce risk and improve dignity, especially in high-stakes moments

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:

- `.claude/skills/having-difficult-conversations`

## How to use

Example prompts:
1) “Help me prepare a difficult performance conversation. I’ll share 3 examples and what I want to be true in 4 weeks.”
2) “Draft a promotion denial talk track that’s direct and includes hope + a path forward. Include a follow-up note and check-in plan.”
