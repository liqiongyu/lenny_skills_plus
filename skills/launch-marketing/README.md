# Launch Marketing (Skill Pack)

Creates an executable **Launch Marketing Pack** for a product/feature/company launch: brief + hook, channel plan, PR outreach kit, internal readiness kit, execution checklist, and measurement/experiment plan.

## Install

- Copy `skills/launch-marketing` into your agent skills directory, or keep it in-repo if your tool auto-discovers skills.

## Use

Invoke the skill when you need a concrete launch plan and launch-ready artifacts.

Typical prompts:
- “Use `launch-marketing` to create a launch marketing plan for our feature launch next month. Audience: mid-market ops teams. Goal: 500 signups. Channels: email + LinkedIn + community.”
- “Use `launch-marketing` to draft an exclusive PR pitch and outreach plan for our startup launch.”

## What you’ll get

The agent should output a **Launch Marketing Pack** in the order defined in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md), using:
- [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md) (question bank)
- [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md) (copy/paste templates)
- [references/WORKFLOW.md](references/WORKFLOW.md) (expanded heuristics)
- [references/CHECKLISTS.md](references/CHECKLISTS.md) + [references/RUBRIC.md](references/RUBRIC.md) (quality gate)

## Notes

- This skill drafts artifacts; **you must approve** anything that is sent externally (press outreach, public posts, customer emails).
