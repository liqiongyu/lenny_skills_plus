# Managing Up (Skill Pack)

Manage up effectively and produce a Managing Up Operating System Pack (manager profile, comms cadence, weekly updates, escalation/ask plan, expectation & boundary script, and exec-ready decision/trade-off memo).

## What you get
- A concrete workflow to set a lightweight, durable “managing up” system (not generic advice)
- Copy/paste templates for weekly updates, decision memos, escalation asks, and working agreements
- Checklists + rubric to keep the pack actionable and leadership-safe

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/managing-up`
- `.claude/skills/managing-up`

## How to use

Invoke “managing up” when you want concrete upward-communication artifacts and a repeatable cadence.

Example prompts:
1) “Create a Managing Up Operating System Pack for me. Include a weekly update template, escalation triggers, and a boundary script for unreasonable asks.”
2) “I need more influence with execs. Build a 30-day seat-at-the-table plan and a decision/trade-off memo template.”
