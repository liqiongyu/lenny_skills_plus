# media-relations

Produce a **Media Relations Pack** for earned media: a newsworthiness brief, targeted media list, exclusive/embargo plan, pitch templates, outreach tracker, interview prep, and press materials checklist.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot + success definition
- Newsworthiness brief (angles + “why now” + proof)
- Tiered media list (outlets/reporters/freelancers + hook per target)
- Exclusive/embargo plan (sequencing + timeline + fallback)
- Pitch kit (emails, subject lines, follow-up cadence)
- Press materials checklist + drafts outline (press release or announcement blog post, media FAQ, assets)
- Outreach tracker spec (statuses + next actions)
- Interview prep (key messages, do/don’t, sensitive topics, bridging)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `media-relations`. Announcement: <what’s new>. Timing: <date/window>. Audience: <who we want to reach>. Goal: <what success looks like>. Geos: <where>. Spokesperson: <who>. Proof/assets: <links/metrics>. Constraints: <what we can’t say>. Output: a Media Relations Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and then proceed with explicit assumptions and placeholders (no invented facts).

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/media-relations/`) using [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “Create a tiered media list and an exclusive plan for our product launch next month.”
- “Write a pitch kit (exclusive + standard pitch) and an outreach tracker for this announcement.”
- “Prep our founder for an interview: talking points, a media FAQ, and sensitive-topic responses.”
