# Negotiating Offers (Skill Pack)

Use this skill to turn an employment offer into an **executable negotiation plan** with concrete artifacts: a success-conditions ask list, a tradeoff matrix, an A/B/C ask package, and ready-to-send scripts.

## How to invoke

Example prompts:
- “Use `negotiating-offers` to create an Offer Negotiation Pack for my PM offer. Here are the offer details and my priorities.”
- “Use `negotiating-offers` to draft a counteroffer email + hiring-manager agenda, focusing on resources I’ll need to succeed.”

## What you get

The skill outputs an **Offer Negotiation Pack** (in chat as Markdown; or as files if requested). Templates and checklists live in `references/`.
