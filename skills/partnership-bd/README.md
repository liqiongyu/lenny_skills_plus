# partnership-bd

Create a **Partnership & BD Execution Pack**: partnership thesis + target list/scoring + pitch + outreach kit + scalable offer + negotiation guardrails + launch plan.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (objective, constraints, baseline)
- Partnership thesis (why partner, why now, partner types, non-goals)
- Partner target list + scoring (top 10–30) + decision-maker + intro path
- Partner pitch kit (1-page pitch + outreach templates)
- Scalable offer + negotiation parameters (tiers, guardrails, what’s standard vs bespoke)
- Deal process plan (MAP/pilot definition, stakeholders, timeline, walk-away)
- Launch + operating cadence (enablement, co-marketing, metrics, check-ins)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `partnership-bd`. Objective: <what outcome + metric>. Partner type: <platform/integration | channel/referral | strategic/co-marketing>. Market/ICP: <who we sell to>. What we offer partners: <API/audience/revenue share/credibility>. Constraints: <timeline, eng/marketing capacity, compliance, exclusivity>. Output: a Partnership & BD Execution Pack with target list + scoring, pitch kit, outreach sequences, negotiation parameters, and launch plan.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see `references/INTAKE.md`) and then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/partnership-bd/`) using `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

## Example prompts
- “Create a partner scoring model and shortlist 15 integration partners.”
- “Draft a platform partnership pitch that offers us as an alpha customer + case study.”
- “Define what’s negotiable vs standard for partnerships so we stop doing bespoke deals.”
