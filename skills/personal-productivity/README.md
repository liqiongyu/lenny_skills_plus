# Personal Productivity (Skill Pack)

Build a Personal Productivity System Pack (weekly timebox plan, capture+to-do system, daily/weekly review rituals, and a 7-day rollout) for career-focused execution.

## What you get
- A concrete workflow to implement **timeboxing** and a **write-it-down** task system
- Copy/paste templates for a default week plan, capture rules, daily shutdown, and weekly review
- Checklists + rubric to keep the system realistic and easy to maintain
