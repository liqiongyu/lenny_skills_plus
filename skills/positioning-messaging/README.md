# positioning-messaging

Create a **Positioning & Messaging Pack**: positioning brief + messaging hierarchy + copy set (one-liner/tagline/headlines) + consistency enablement + validation plan.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (ICP, use case, surfaces, constraints)
- Positioning brief (category + “against” alternative + differentiation + proof + tradeoffs)
- Messaging hierarchy (core message + 3 pillars + proof + objections)
- Copy set (one-liner, elevator pitch, tagline options, homepage hero headline/subhead, CTAs)
- Consistency enablement (“say this / not that”, internal script, sales talk track)
- Validation plan (comprehension + recall tests, decision rule)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `positioning-messaging`. Product: <what it is>. ICP: <who>. Use case: <job>. Alternative: <status quo/competitor>. Proof: <results/quotes>. Surfaces: <website/sales/press>. Constraints: <tone/claims>. Output: a Positioning & Messaging Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/positioning-messaging/`) using [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “We’re a developer tool; people keep asking ‘so what is it?’. Create positioning against the status quo and rewrite our homepage hero.”
- “Draft a messaging hierarchy for two personas (buyer vs end user) and include proof points and objections.”
- “Give me 10 tagline/headline options and a lightweight plan to test which one’s remembered.”
