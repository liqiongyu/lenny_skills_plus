# Post-mortems & Retrospectives (Skill Pack)

Run blameless post-mortems and retrospectives that turn failures (and near-misses) into **system learnings, decisions, and follow-through**.

## What you get
- A repeatable 7-step workflow for incident postmortems and project/OKR retros
- Copy/paste templates: brief + agenda, timeline, contributing factors, action tracker, kill criteria
- Checklists + rubric to keep the retro blameless, evidence-based, and action-oriented

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:

Example prompts:
1) “Run a blameless postmortem for <incident>. Output the full Pack and a 1-page exec shareout.”
2) “Lead a Q-end OKR retrospective focused on learning (not the grade). Output decisions, actions, and kill criteria for next quarter.”
