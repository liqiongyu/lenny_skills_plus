# product-led-sales

Create a **Product-Led Sales Motion Pack**: PQL/PQA definition + usage-signal spec + routing/SLA + outreach kit + instrumentation + pilot/scale plan.

## What this skill produces
- Context + goal snapshot (segment, objective, success metrics, constraints)
- PLS funnel + ownership map (intervention points, RACI, SLAs)
- PQL/PQA definition + signal spec (thresholds/scoring, false-positive controls)
- Routing + workflow spec (alerts, assignment, dispositions, feedback loop)
- Usage-triggered outreach kit (emails + call opener + follow-up rules)
- Instrumentation + reporting plan (dashboards + leading indicators)
- Pilot + scale plan (experiment design, cadence, guardrails)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `product-led-sales`. Product: <what it is + freemium/trial model>. ICP: <roles + company types + ACV band>. Objective: <conversion/expansion/ACV lift>. Signals available: <events + account mapping>. Sales capacity: <roles + SLAs>. Constraints: <compliance + messaging>. Output: a Product-Led Sales Motion Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see `references/INTAKE.md`) and then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/product-led-sales/`) using `references/TEMPLATES.md`.

## Example prompts
- “We’re adding sales to PLG—define PQLs and routing rules based on usage signals.”
- “Sales is drowning in alerts—design a scoring model and SLA that fits our capacity.”
- “Create a 4-week pilot plan to prove product-led sales improves expansion.”
