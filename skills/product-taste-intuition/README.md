# product-taste-intuition

Build stronger **product taste + intuition** as a PM by running a **Taste Calibration Sprint** (benchmark set → critique notes → taste rules → intuition→hypotheses → validation plan → practice loop).

## What this skill produces
- Taste Calibration Brief (domain, target user/job, constraints, criteria, tradeoffs)
- Benchmark Set (5–10 products) + what to study
- Product Study Notes (consistent critique template)
- Taste Rules + Anti-Patterns (do/don’t rules)
- Intuition → Hypothesis Log (testable hypotheses + predicted signals)
- Validation Plan (smallest viable qual + quant checks)
- Practice Plan (2–4 weeks: exposure hours + synthesis cadence)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `product-taste-intuition`. Domain: <onboarding/activation/etc>. Target user + job: <...>. Benchmarks: <list or ‘unknown—propose’>. Time box: <...>. Constraints: <platform/brand/compliance>. Output: a Taste Calibration Pack.”

If key details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/product-taste-intuition/`) using [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “Calibrate onboarding taste for our fintech app. Propose benchmarks and produce a Taste Calibration Pack.”
- “Turn my intuition about our pricing page into hypotheses and a validation plan.”
- “Create a 4-week practice plan for improving product sense in B2B SaaS.”
