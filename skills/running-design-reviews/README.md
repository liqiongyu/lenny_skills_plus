# Running Design Reviews (Skill Pack)

This skill helps a **product designer / design lead / design manager** (and cross-functional partners) run design reviews that produce concrete outcomes: prioritized feedback, decisions, and follow-through.

## Install

If you’re using this repo directly, the skill is discoverable under:
- `skills/running-design-reviews`

Repo convention: this skill should also be mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/running-design-reviews`
- `.claude/skills/running-design-reviews`

## Use

Invoke with a concrete request and context. Examples:
- “Run a design critique for this onboarding flow; we need to decide what to change before next Tuesday.”
- “Create a design review brief + agenda + feedback log for a 45-minute live review.”
- “Synthesize these scattered comments into Value/Ease/Delight priorities and next steps.”

Expected deliverable: a **Design Review Pack** as described in `SKILL.md`, using templates in `references/TEMPLATES.md`.
