# Running Effective 1:1s (Skill Pack)

Run effective 1:1s and skip-levels as a manager/leader and produce a 1:1 Operating System Pack (cadence plan, agendas, shared doc templates, coaching prompts, career conversation plan, and quality gates).

## What you get
- A concrete workflow to redesign 1:1s away from status updates and toward coaching + growth
- Copy/paste templates for agendas, shared 1:1 docs, career conversations, skip-levels, and special situations
- Checklists + rubric to keep your 1:1 system lightweight and effective
