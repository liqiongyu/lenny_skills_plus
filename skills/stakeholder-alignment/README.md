# Stakeholder Alignment (Skill Pack)

This skill helps a **Product/Tech leader** create durable stakeholder alignment (including exec alignment and cross-functional buy-in) by producing a concrete **Stakeholder Alignment Pack**: 1-pager brief, stakeholder map, alignment plan, pre-read + meeting plan, and follow-up comms.

## Install

If you’re using this repo directly, the skill is discoverable under:
- `skills/stakeholder-alignment`

Repo convention: this skill should also be mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/stakeholder-alignment`
- `.claude/skills/stakeholder-alignment`

## Use

Invoke with a concrete alignment goal and context. Examples:
- “Map stakeholders and build a plan to align them on this proposal.”
- “Draft an alignment pre-read + meeting plan + follow-up comms for exec buy-in.”
- “We keep leaving meetings ‘aligned’ and then un-aligning—create a no-surprises process.”

Expected deliverable: a **Stakeholder Alignment Pack** as described in `SKILL.md`, using templates in `references/TEMPLATES.md`.
