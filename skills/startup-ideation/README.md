# startup-ideation

Create a **Startup Ideation Pack**: a structured set of opportunity theses + a scorecard + a top idea 1‑pager + a 2‑week validation plan.

## What this skill produces
- Context snapshot (decision, timeline, constraints)
- Unfair advantage + off-the-beaten-path signals
- Shift scan + Why Now candidates
- Opportunity theses table (15–30 structured ideas)
- Tarpit & differentiation check (prune + notes)
- Idea scorecard (top 3–5)
- Top idea brief (1‑pager)
- 2‑week validation plan
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `startup-ideation`. Context: <team background + domain>. Constraints: <time/budget/skills>. Decision: <what we need to pick by when>. Output: a Startup Ideation Pack.”

If details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/startup-ideation/`) using the templates in [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “We’re 2 founders with fintech + compliance experience. Generate startup ideas; avoid tarpits; pick 1 to validate in 14 days.”
- “We have 6 ideas for AI in customer support. Score them, pick the best, and draft a 1‑pager + validation plan.”
- “I’m a PM switching to startup land. Help me diversify my information diet and produce opportunity theses rooted in my experience.”
