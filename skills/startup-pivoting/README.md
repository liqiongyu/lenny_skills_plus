# Startup Pivoting (Skill Pack)

Turn “should we pivot?” into a concrete **Pivot Decision & Execution Pack** with decision gates, metrics, and a time-boxed validation/execution plan.

## What you get
- A structured workflow for deciding **pivot vs persevere**
- Copy/paste templates for: exhaustion check, pivot options map, pivot thesis card, validation plan, execution plan, decision memo
- Checklists + rubric to keep pivoting evidence-based and time-bounded

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/startup-pivoting`
- `.claude/skills/startup-pivoting`

## How to use

Invoke “startup pivoting” when you want decision-ready artifacts (not general advice).

Example prompts:
1) “We’re stuck pre-PMF. Here’s our product, ICP, funnel metrics, and runway. Produce a full Pivot Decision & Execution Pack.”
2) “Create a pivot options map (10% vs 200% pivots) and pick a pivot thesis with metrics + kill criteria.”
