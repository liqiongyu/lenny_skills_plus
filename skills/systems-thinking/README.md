# systems-thinking

Create a **Systems Thinking Pack** to make better leadership decisions in complex ecosystems: map actors and incentives, reveal feedback loops and delays, anticipate second-order effects, and choose leverage-point interventions (including “build a system” to reduce recurring pain).

## What this skill produces
- Context + system boundary (goal, scope/non-scope, horizon)
- Actors & incentives map (players, power, constraints)
- System map (variables + causal links) + feedback loops + time delays
- Second-/third-order effects ledger (top 1–3 candidate moves)
- Leverage points + intervention plan (owners, indicators, guardrails)
- System-build opportunities (automation/standardization candidates)
- Risks / Open questions / Next steps

## How to use (prompt)
Use language like:

“Use `systems-thinking`. Context: <problem + decision>. Outcome: <desired outcome>. Horizon: <timeframe>. Constraints: <guardrails>. Output: a Systems Thinking Pack.”

If details are missing, the skill will ask up to 5 intake questions (see [references/INTAKE.md](references/INTAKE.md)) and then proceed with explicit assumptions.

## Optional file output
If you want the deliverables as files, ask the agent to write them under a folder you specify (e.g., `docs/systems-thinking/`) using the templates in [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).

## Example prompts
- “We’re reorganizing ownership across teams. Map the incentives and feedback loops and propose interventions with guardrails.”
- “Our growth loop stalled. Create a systems map, identify leverage points, and list second-order effects for 2 candidate moves.”
- “We keep repeating the same manual process each quarter. Use systems thinking to design a lightweight system/automation to eliminate it.”
