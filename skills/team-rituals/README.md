# Team Rituals (Skill Pack)

Design a lightweight set of **named, templated Golden Rituals** and produce a **Team Rituals Pack** (ritual inventory, ritual specs + agendas, onboarding primer, rollout + iteration plan).

## Install

- Canonical location: `skills/team-rituals/`
- For auto-discovery, mirror to:
  - `.codex/skills/team-rituals/`
  - `.claude/skills/team-rituals/`

## Use

Invoke this skill when you need a concrete team operating cadence:

- “Design our team rituals / operating cadence.”
- “Create Golden Rituals that are named, templated, and known by first Friday.”
- “Our meetings are a mess—make a minimal, effective cadence with templates.”

## What you get (deliverables)

1) Context snapshot + goals + constraints
2) Ritual inventory audit (keep/change/kill)
3) Golden Rituals shortlist (3–7 named rituals mapped to outcomes)
4) Ritual specs + templates (agendas/notes)
5) Onboarding primer (first Friday cheatsheet)
6) Rollout plan (pilot + comms + setup)
7) Governance plan (review + iteration + retirement)
8) Risks / Open questions / Next steps

Templates and checklists live in `skills/team-rituals/references/`.
