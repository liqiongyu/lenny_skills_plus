# Usability Testing (Skill Pack)

This skill helps a **Product Manager** (and partners) plan, run, and synthesize high-signal usability tests into concrete artifacts: test plan, moderator guide, notes template, issue log, and a prioritized findings readout.

## Install

If you’re using this repo directly, the skill is discoverable under:
- `skills/usability-testing`

Repo convention: this skill should also be mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/usability-testing`
- `.claude/skills/usability-testing`

## Use

Invoke with a concrete flow and decision context. Examples:
- “Create a usability test plan + moderator guide for our checkout redesign.”
- “Design a Wizard of Oz usability test to validate an AI feature before building.”
- “Synthesize these usability notes into a prioritized issue list with recommendations.”

Expected deliverable: a **Usability Test Pack** as described in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md), using templates in [references/TEMPLATES.md](references/TEMPLATES.md).
