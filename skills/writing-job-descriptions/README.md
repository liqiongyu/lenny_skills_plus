# Writing Job Descriptions (Skill Pack)

Write outcome-based, high-signal job descriptions and role scorecards that attract the right candidates and filter the wrong ones.

## What you get
- A repeatable workflow to go from “we should hire X” → **scorecard + spikes + JD draft**
- Copy/paste templates for a complete **Job Description Pack**
- Checklists + rubric to keep JDs specific, honest, and non-generic

## Install

This repo’s canonical skills live in `skills/`. For tool auto-discovery, this pack is mirrored to:
- `.codex/skills/writing-job-descriptions`
- `.claude/skills/writing-job-descriptions`

## How to use

Invoke “writing job descriptions” when you want concrete artifacts (not general advice).

Example prompts:
1) “Write a job description for a Senior PM for <company>. Start with success at 12 months, define major/minor spikes, then output the full Job Description Pack.”
2) “Rewrite our existing JD (below) to be outcome-based and more high-signal. Keep it inclusive and add a ‘who will thrive / who won’t’ section.”
